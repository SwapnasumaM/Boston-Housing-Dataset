#Predicting Median value of owner-occupied homes

The aim of this assignment is to learn the application of machine learning algorithms to data sets. This involves learning what data means, how to handle data, training, cross validation, prediction, testing your model, etc.
This dataset contains information collected by the U.S Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston Mass. It was obtained from the StatLib archive, and has been used extensively throughout the literature to benchmark algorithms. The data was originally published by Harrison, D. and Rubinfeld, D.L. Hedonic prices and the demand for clean air', J. Environ. Economics & Management, vol.5, 81-102, 1978.
The dataset is small in size with only 506 cases. It can be used to predict the median value of a home, which is done here. There are 14 attributes in each case of the dataset. They are:

1. CRIM - per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN - proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS - proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. CHAS - Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX - nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM - average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE - proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS - weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
9. RAD - index of accessibility to radial highways
10.TAX - full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11.PTRATIO - pupil-teacher ratio by town
12.B - 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13.LSTAT - % lower status of the population
14.MEDV - Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

Ground Cricket Chirps
In The Song of Insects (1948) by George W. Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures. Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature. Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.

In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60ยบ F. or warmer than 100ยบ F.

# Assignment 6

Brain vs. Body Weight
In the file brain_body.txt, the average brain and body weight for a number of mammal species are recorded. Load this data into a Pandas data frame.

Tasks
Find the linear regression equation for this data for brain weight to body weight.
Chart the original data and the equation on the chart.
Find the equation's  R2  score (use the .score method) to determine whether the equation is a good fit for this data. (0.8 and greater is considered a strong correlation.)

# Assignment 7

Salary Discrimination
The file salary.txt contains data for 52 tenure-track professors at a small Midwestern college. This data was used in legal proceedings in the 1980s about discrimination against women in salary.

The data in the file, by column:

Sex. 1 for female, 0 for male.
Rank. 1 for assistant professor, 2 for associate professor, 3 for full professor.
Year. Number of years in current rank.
Degree. Highest degree. 1 for doctorate, 0 for master's.
YSdeg. Years since highest degree was earned.
Salary. Salary/year in dollars.
